# APAN5310-Group6-Project-DreamHome-NYC

Dream Homes NYC is a real estate company that assists people in buying and selling luxury homes in New York City. Our team of database specialists has been invited to address two primary challenges. First, we will transform years of archived, unstructured data—ranging from legacy spreadsheets to scanned documents—into a clean, well-organized repository that supports efficient search and analysis. Second, we will implement an automated pipeline to combine and merge multiple real-time data sources into this unified system, eliminating the need for any manual data transfers. As all of our group members are international students who have experienced the challenges of finding and renting housing in New York City, we’re excited to explore and find a solution to handle the large volume of data across properties, clients, and agents.

We chose to work on Dream Homes NYC because its centralized database is complex, and we’re passionate about using technology to simplify real-world challenges. We’re motivated by the opportunity to apply our database expertise to turn chaotic information into clear, actionable insights, helping organizations make faster, smarter decisions and reduce the workload of data tasks for employees. To ensure we deliver the best solution to the goal, we began by sharing a small, cleaned sample of our combined property, client, and transaction data with a link to the full dataset on GitHub, and explaining why it reflects Dream Homes NYC’s real-world needs. Then we’ll explain step by step through our database design, complete with a PDF ER diagram that includes all of the relationships and cardinality between tables, which were created through SQL code. Next, we’ll detail our automated ETL process in Python that imports data from old records and current data sources, explains every transformation choice, and loads everything into our new schema. Once the data is in place, we’ll show advanced analyses with the exact SQL or Python code and the resulting insights to answer those key business questions. We’ll also explain how analysts can query the database directly (or via Python/R) while managers and executives can view clear, automatically refreshed dashboards in Metabase. Finally, we’ll cover our plans for database performance, redundancy, and a cloud-based deployment, then wrap up with a concise conclusion that highlights how our relational database, ETL pipeline, and analytics work together to give Dream Homes NYC faster, smarter decision-making and a single source of truth.

This unified database will reduce manual errors, eliminate duplicate records, and save time spent on data cleanup. Brokers will be able to price listings based on the latest comparable sales in minutes, rather than days, and marketing teams can see in real-time which channels are driving inquiries, allowing them to reallocate budgets on the fly. Managers and executives will have clear, automatically updated dashboards that show revenue trends, agent performance, and neighborhood activity in a short time, letting them spot problems or opportunities as they emerge. Analysts will spend less time wrangling files and more time uncovering insights, like which client segments are most likely to convert or which amenities boost sale prices, while non-technical staff can rely on intuitive dashboards.
